A quick and dirty setup guide:

1. Get the source
	git clone the repo

2. Get prerequisites
	Install couchdb to your system
	Install npm to your system

3. Pull web app components for EER
	cd EquineEventReporter
	npm install
	node_modules/bower/bin/bower install

4. Start EER
	Start couchdb
	./run_eer.sh
	Open a browser to http://localhost:3000

You can access the site on a different machine than the one that's hosting it, but you really shouldn't - it's twitchy and insecure.
Don't click on stuff quickly or you'll piss couch and/or the application off.

If the website isn't working, the local server is probably down.
If you get lots of red curly braces in the website, couch probably isn't running.
If everything but generating pairings is working, the mwm daemon probably isn't running.
